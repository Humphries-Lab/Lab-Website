We love to work with curious, kind people. Learn more about our lab from the [Lab Manual](https://humphries-lab.github.io/Lab-Manual).

## Open positions
### Research assistant
Closing date: December 4th 2024

We're seeking a predoctoral research assistant to join a project optimising patient selection for deep brain stimulation, in collaboration with MachineMedicine Technologies and St George’s Hospital, London. 

A crucial unmet need in the management of Parkinson’s disease is how to reliably identify patients that would benefit from deep brain stimulation, the most effective treatment for Parkinson’s. The project team is creating a machine-learning/AI platform that synthesises wide-ranging personal and clinical data to predict the suitability of each Parkinson’s disease patient for deep brain stimulation. You will co-develop the machine learning pipeline, seeking the best way to predict improvements in the patients’ motor symptoms and quality of life. 

The post is for 6 months, and would suit predoctoral candidates seeking research experience.

## Potential lab positions
### Independent research fellows
The Humphries Lab has a great track record of hosting independent research fellows studying the computations of neural populations. We welcome enquiries from candidates who would like to apply for an independent research fellowship with our support. Please send a rough proposal, idea of targeted funding bodies, and CV [to Mark](../members/mark-humphries).
<br>
<br>
Suitable fellowship schemes are available from a range of UK funders. The University of Nottingham also offers its own [tenure-track research fellowships](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/research/researchwithus/fellowships/nottingham-research.aspx), for which we're happy to discuss support. 

### Postdoctoral researchers
Postdoc positions in the UK are funded by specific grants. All postdoc posts are advertised on [jobs.ac.uk](https://www.jobs.ac.uk/), and will appear above under <b>Open positions</b>.

### Graduate students

UK universities recruit most PhD students through their PhD programs. The University of Nottingham has [a range of PhD programs](https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/doctoral-training-centres/our-centres.aspx). Any projects we have available through these PhD programs will appear above under <b>Open positions</b>. UK PhDs start in October; programs open for applications anytime between the preceding December and May - check the specific program's calls for deadlines.

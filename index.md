### We are a neural data lab.

We interrogate how the joint activity of many neurons encodes the past, present, and future in order to guide behaviour.  We develop neural data analysis techniques, and use them to understand what joint activity is encoding in recordings of hundreds or thousands of neurons, from across different tasks, brain circuits, species, and phyla. And we develop theoretical and computational models for how this joint activity arises from neural circuits.

### Tracking subjects' choice strategies at trial resolution
Investigating how, when, and what subjects learn during decision-making tasks requires tracking their choice strategies on a trial-by-trial basis. In our new paper, we present a simple but effective probabilistic approach to tracking choice strategies at trial resolution, and show We show it identifies both successful learning and the exploratory strategies used in decision tasks performed by humans, non-human primates, rats, and synthetic agents.

### Computing the probability of connection between two neurons
March 2022

In a new lab paper, we introduce a new Bayesian approach to computing the probability of connection between classes of neuron, its distance dependence, and the strength of evidence for it. We use this approach to synthesis the most complete map of the striatal microcircuit currently available.

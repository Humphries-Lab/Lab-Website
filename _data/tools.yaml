  description: Strategy Tracker lets you track a subject's use of choice strategies across every trial. Track learning of the current rule; track rule switches; track the exploratory strategies the subject uses. Use the output to define learning, or to trigger live changes during an experiment. Read the accompanying [paper in eLife ](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.86491). We released toolboxes [in MATLAB](https://github.com/Humphries-Lab/Bayesian_Strategy_Analysis_MATLAB) and [in Python](https://github.com/Humphries-Lab/Bayesian_Strategy_Analysis_Python).

  description: Find the low-dimensional structure of a network, if one exists. Uses a spectral approach to estimate departures from a specified null model network, outputing the low-dimensional structure and nodes that belong to it. The output can be used to estimate the dimensionality of any data expressed as a network. See the accompanying paper [Spectral estimation for detecting low-dimensional structure in networks using arbitrary null models](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0254057). The linked toolbox is [in MATLAB](https://github.com/mdhumphries/NetworkNoiseRejection); we thank Thomas Delaney for the [Python port](https://github.com/thomasjdelaney/Network_Noise_Rejection_Python).

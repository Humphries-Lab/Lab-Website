  description: A model of the 3D anatomical network of the striatum's GABAergic microcircuit between the SPNs and FSIs. Neurons are Izhikevich  models tuned to reproduce key dynamic properties. Includes dopaminergic modulation of ion channels and synaptic connections.  Scalable to any volume of striatal tissue. The code here is from [Humphries et al 2010 PLoS Computational Biology](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001011). An updated version of the model is in [Tomkins et al 2014 Front Comput Neurosci](https://doi.org/10.3389/fncom.2013.00192).

  description: The code here is from [Humphries, Stewart & Gurney (2006) J Neurosci](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3486-06.2006). Journal of Neuroscience,This model aimed at a rigorous test of the “action selection” theory of basal ganglia: we showed that a basal ganglia model implementing action selection was consistent with a wide range of electrophysiological data on the dynamics of the basal ganglia nuclei. In addition, here we advanced the hypothesis that dopamine acts to de-couple the subthalamic nucleus (STN) – globus pallidus (GP) negative feedback loop in normal conditions, and that a reduction in tonic dopamine will re-couple the feedback loop. Consequently, we proposed that in parkinsonian states this loop will be permanently re-coupled, producing pathological rhythms that interfere with normal selection operation in the basal ganglia. Our hypothesis has been further tested by others (e.g. Holgado et al, 2010, J Neurosci; Hahn & McIntyre, 2010, J Comput Neurosci) who showed that such a re-coupling indeed produces pathological rhythmic dynamics.

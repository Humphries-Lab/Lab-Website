  description: A model of the 3D anatomical network of the striatum's GABAergic microcircuit between the SPNs and FSIs. Neurons are Izhikevich  models tuned to reproduce key dynamic properties. Includes dopaminergic modulation of ion channels and synaptic connections.  Scalable to any volume of striatal tissue. The code here is from [Humphries et al 2010 PLoS Computational Biology](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001011). An updated version of the model is in [Tomkins et al 2014 Front Comput Neurosci](https://doi.org/10.3389/fncom.2013.00192).

  description: The code here is from [Humphries, Stewart and Gurney (2006) J Neurosci](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3486-06.2006). A rigorous test of the "action selection" theory of basal ganglia: we showed that a basal ganglia model implementing action selection was consistent with a wide range of electrophysiological data on the dynamics of the basal ganglia nuclei.

Notes on editing
- The "main" branch is locked. Here's how to edit:
  - Start: create a new branch from "main"
  - make edits: easiest is to do the edits directly on GitHub. 
  - preview by making a pull request from that branch. This will create a preview version of the edits: the link to that preview is in the comments on the Pull Request itself
  - Once the pull request is opened, every commit of an edit will automatically update the preview website. Note that the build process can take a few minutes (check it's status under Pull Requests).
  - Finished: Merge to the branch back to the main branch when satisfied. This will update the website.
- edit index.md in the root and main folders to change static content and layout of the main pages
- current paper tags: basal-ganglia, Aplysia, dopamine, network-theory, prefrontal-cortex, latent-dynamics
